# predicting-credit-card-approvals
Commercial banks receive a lot of credit card applications, many of them get rejected for various reasons like high loan balances, low income levels etc. Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error prone and time consuming, luckily this task can be automated with machine learning and pretty much every commercial bank does so nowadays. 

In this project I will build a machine learning model to predict credit card approvals
